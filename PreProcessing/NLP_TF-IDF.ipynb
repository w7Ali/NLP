    "In the field of Natural Language Processing i.e., NLP, Lemmatization and Stemming are Text Normalization techniques. These techniques are used to prepare words, text, and documents for further processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Languages such as English, Hindi consists of several words which are often derived from one another. Further, Inflected Language is a term used for a language that contains derived words. For instance, word “historical” is derived from the word “history” and hence is the derived word.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is always a common root form for all inflected words. Further, degree of inflection varies from lower to higher depending on the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "To sum up, root form of derived or inflected words are attained using Stemming and Lemmatization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The package namely, nltk.stem is used to perform stemming via different classes. We import PorterStemmer from nltk.stem to perform the above task.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, ran, runs, and running are derived from one word i.e., run, therefore the lemma of all three words is run. Lemmatization is used to get valid words as the actual word is returned. </h4>"
